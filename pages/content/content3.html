                This project was an attempt to learn the art of photography. In a day. I'm optimistic like that. To be honest, I don't know much about photography and lighting. But I do find it interesting to capture specific objects frozen in time. 
                <br><br>
                The idea was taking everyday objects and turning them into the best versions of themselves. 
                <br><br>
                This mini-series is called Pære for the fun of it. I tried editing the pictures in a modest and honest way, only removing specific spots and patches, and adding a bit of colour for contrast. 
                <br><br>
                Maybe I should expand the series with other fruits and veggies? Let me know, if you have any suggestions.
                <br><br>
                Thanks for stopping by!
