                    <p class="white">Let me start by introducing myself. My name is Sarah Birkkjær. I'm a web designer and developer based in Odense. What I love most about what I do, is being able to create beautiful digital platforms that speaks to people. 
                    <br><br>When I'm not doing web-stuff, I like doing ceramics. It doesn't always turn out the way I had imagined, but that applies to web design as well I think. You test a lot, see what works and if something doesn't - you just adjust or try something else.<br><br> 
                        I'm very passionate and creative as a person, and I love spending time with other passionate souls.
