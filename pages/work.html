            <br>
            <p class="black">I always start out any project with thorough research. It's crucial to me, to have made the right preparations, before moving on to the design phase. 
                My workflow gets affected, if my stuff isn't organized.
                <br><br>The things that inspire me the most are colours and clean lines. I love contrast and I'll usually go for simplicity in a design, if I have the choice. Details to me, is all that matters. I'd rather keep a simple design that works, then a design with too many elements, that doesn't work together. 
                <br><br>I work great in teams and by myself, but I would always prefer working in a team. Bouncing ideas off others helps my workflow a lot, and usually the end result turns out better. 
                <br><br>Take a look at some of my latest work, if you'd like. Enjoy!</p>
